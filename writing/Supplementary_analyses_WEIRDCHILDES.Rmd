### Code to reproduce information in the caption to Figure 1

We classified countries as Western and Democratic. For Western, we classified as Western all of the countries in Western Europe (according to EuroVoc: Andorra, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom) as well as a few others in Europe (Italy, Portugal, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark), most of North America (with the exception of Bermuda and Greenland), and two countries in Oceania (Australia, New Zealand). This resulted in `r sum(ind_all$western == "Western")` Western and `r sum(ind_all$western == "non-Western")` non-Western countries. For democratic, we simplified the OWID's classification of closed and electoral autocracies into autocracies, versus electoral and liberal democracies into democracies (Our World in data, 2022c). 
We had data on political regime for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$Political.regime_t))` countries (from Our World in Data, OWID, 2011); on the proportion of the population having completed lower secondary school `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$Compl.LS))` (from OWID, 2007-2014); on GDP  for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD))` countries (from WDI, 2011); on the proportion of the population that was urban for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$SP.URB.TOTL.ZS))` countries (from WDI, 2011); on fertility for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$Fertility))` countries (from OWID, 2011).

## SM3:  Integration with previous research on indirect measures of word comprehension

In the Introduction, we argued that direct measures are less subject than indirect (parental report) ones to reporting biases in the context of at potential association with SES. Indeed, the research suggests that the strength and even sign of the correlation between SES and vocabulary depends on which particular version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI) is used Chapter 6, @frank2021variability].
The MB-CDI is an *indirect* method because, rather than the investigator directly testing the child, a caregiver is asked to complete a questionnaire about the words that their child understands and/or says, thus yielding a comprehension vocabulary estimate (based on "understands" reports) and/or expressive vocabulary estimate (based on "says" reports). 

An analysis of WordBank, a repository containing data from more than 32,000 children learning at least one of 11 different languages used maternal education as a proxy for SES, finding that, for all 11 languages, there is a positive correlation between expressive vocabulary and SES, whereas for comprehension this correlation was negative for 8 of them [Chapter 6, @frank2021variability].
The authors put forward the idea that reporting biases might explain these results, whereby low SES mothers might have a greater tendency to overestimate their children's vocabulary comprehension. 

Additionally, @frank2021variability argue that memory demands and educational attainment, in particular, may affect parents' accuracy in completing the checklist. If so, direct measurements of young children's word comprehension may show more consistent results and a clearer ensuing picture with respect to the potential association between SES and word comprehension. This idea reinforced our choice to focused on *direct* measurements of word comprehension for the present meta-analysis.

However, one could argue that indirect measures are better in other ways. Indeed, direct measures measure word comprehension in a rather isolated context, are affected by online processing, and some of them further required an overt decision. In these, children are supposed to hear the labelled word then point, touch, or look at a decontextualized image (or often, a sketch or drawing) of the corresponding item, and they are tested by unfamiliar adults. It stands to reason that a very different perspective may be visible in work relying on contextualized word comprehension by people familiar with the child. 
Although we do not have an answer to the question of whether direct or indirect measurements are better, we undertook the following analyses to check whether the distribution of correlations obtained through our meta-analytic approached was compatible with the distribution of correlations found in comprehension MB-CDI data deposited in WordBank [@frank2021variability].

#### Joining datasets and running meta-regression

For this we downloaded WordBank data on 2022-08-24, focusing on comprehension using the Words and Gestures (WG) form (for simplicity, we excluded the Words and Sentences form). We excluded records where maternal education was missing, and converted the categorical levels of WordBank into the following years of education levels: Primary = 7; Some Secondary = 10, Secondary = 12, Some College = 14, College = 16, Some Graduate=18, Graduate = 20. Then, for each language and age group, we estimated a correlation coefficient between the years of education and the comprehension score (we used a Spearman's correlation coefficient, as it is more robust and more in line with the categorical nature of the original data). 

We merged our meta-analytic data with the correlation coefficients calculated in Wordbank's Comprehension data, as explained above. We then fit a robust variance estimation meta-regression with method (direct versus CDI) and age in interaction. This revealed a significant interaction (b = `r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min.directDirect","b.r"],3)`, 
t(`r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min.directDirect","dfs"],1)`) 
= `r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min.directDirect","t"],3)`, 
p `r pfun(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min.directDirect","prob"])`), because the correlation between SES and word comprehension increased with age more slowly for direct methods than for Wordbank comprehension scores. There was also a significant main effect of age (b = `r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min","b.r"],3)`, 
t(`r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min","dfs"],1)`) 
= `r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min","t"],3)`, 
p `r pfun(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="age.min","prob"])`), because correlation coefficients increased with age. And finally, there was a significant main effect of method (b = `r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="directDirect","b.r"],3)`, 
t(`r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="directDirect","dfs"],1)`) 
= `r round(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="directDirect","t"],3)`, 
p `r pfun(robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table[robu_fit_age_wb$reg_table$labels=="directDirect","prob"])`), because there was a significantly higher association between children's word comprehension and SES for direct methods than Wordbank comprehension scores. 
Together, these results suggest that direct and indirect measurements of infants' word comprehension relate differently to familial SES.

## SM4: Analyses separating USA samples from all others


```{r USA,  include=FALSE,echo=F,warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
robu_fit_USA <- robu(yi ~ isUSA*age.min, data = all,
                 modelweights = "HIER", studynum = infant_group,
                 var.eff.size = vi)
```




This is a first, admittedly rough, approach to looking at country-level variation, since here we are putting together data from e.g. Argentina and Norway. Nonetheless, it is useful just to have an idea of the extent to which we can extrapolate from the most common, namely American (in the sense of residing in USA) samples. We fit a robust variance estimation meta-regression with both a binary factor (USA versus not USA) and age in interaction. This revealed a main effect of country of origin, with a higher estimate for USA versus all of the others 
(b = `r round(robu_fit_USA$reg_table[robu_fit_USA$reg_table$labels=="isUSATRUE","b.r"],3)`, 
t(`r round(robu_fit_USA$reg_table[robu_fit_USA$reg_table$labels=="isUSATRUE","dfs"],1)`) 
= `r round(robu_fit_USA$reg_table[robu_fit_USA$reg_table$labels=="isUSATRUE","t"],3)`, 
p `r pfun(robu_fit_USA$reg_table[robu_fit_USA$reg_table$labels=="isUSATRUE","prob"])`). Note that this effect was also present in an analysis not controlling for age; and the interpretation for effects being larger in USA versus elsewhere is also warranted in view of the Figure SM4.

## SM5 Variation in inequality in the represented countries

In the main manuscript, we describe represented countries as follows: "Nearly all are also high income, the exceptions being Argentina and Chile, which are middle-income countries, such that no low-income country is represented. These countries also do not represent extremes in income inequality, with GINI coefficients ranging from 31 (France) to 45 (Mexico), whereas the observed distribution of GINI in the world in 2020 spanned from 24 (Sweden) to 54 (Colombia; see SM5)."

The numbers we provide for included countries were the latest available from World Bank data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI, visited on 2023-04-21). The numbers we provide from all countries also come from the same World Bank data, but focus on 2020 as the most recent year with a high proportion of available data.

We classified countries as Western and Democratic. For Western, we classified as Western all of the countries in Western Europe (according to EuroVoc: Andorra, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom) as well as a few others in Europe (Italy, Portugal, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark), most of North America (with the exception of Bermuda and Greenland), and two countries in Oceania (Australia, New Zealand). This resulted in `r sum(ind_all$western == "Western")` Western and `r sum(ind_all$western == "non-Western")` non-Western countries. For democratic, we simplified the OWID's classification of closed and electoral autocracies into autocracies, versus electoral and liberal democracies into democracies (Our World in data, 2022c). 
We had data on political regime for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$Political.regime_t))` countries (from Our World in Data, OWID, 2011); on the proportion of the population having completed lower secondary school `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$Compl.LS))` (from OWID, 2007-2014); on GDP  for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD))` countries (from WDI, 2011); on the proportion of the population that was urban for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$SP.URB.TOTL.ZS))` countries (from WDI, 2011); on fertility for `r sum(!is.na(ind_all$Fertility))` countries (from OWID, 2011).

The answer to the question of who surrounds the child may also depend on how large the nuclear family is. There is considerable cross-population variation in terms of the average number of children a woman has in her reproductive lifetime, varying between a little over 1 (`r paste0(ind_all[which(ind_all$Fertility==min(ind_all$Fertility,na.rm=T)),"Fertility"],", ",ind_all[which(ind_all$Fertility==min(ind_all$Fertility,na.rm=T)),"country"])`) to over 6 (`r paste0(ind_all[which(ind_all$Fertility==max(ind_all$Fertility,na.rm=T)),"Fertility"],", ",ind_all[which(ind_all$Fertility==max(ind_all$Fertility,na.rm=T)),"country"])`).

## Methods

### Code to reproduce text on p. 16

A total of `r nrow(all_annotations)` corpora were initially considered. We excluded  `r excl["Clinical"]` because at least some of the children were not typically developing;  `r excl["In lab/school"]` because data was collected in the lab or school; `r excl["Not available"]` because data was not available; `r excl["Only child transcribed"]` because only the child was transcribed; `r excl["Diary"]` because they were diary studies; `r excl["Task-oriented"]` because speech was triggered by a task (elicitation, story-telling, etc.); `r excl["Unfamiliar adult"]` because the conversation involved exclusively unfamiliar adults. After these exclusions, `r nrow(annotations)` remained. The following analyses will continue only on these included corpora.

The samples are varied in geographic terms, with corpora for every populated continent. Specifically, `r sum(annotations$continent=="Africa")` corpora were collected in Africa; `r sum(annotations$continent=="Asia")` in Asia; `r sum(annotations$continent=="Western Europe")` in Western Europe, and a further `r sum(annotations$continent=="Non-Western Europe")` in Non-Western Europe; `r sum(annotations$continent=="North America")` in North America and `r sum(annotations$continent=="Western Europe")` in Latin America. Only `r sum(annotations$continent=="Oceania")` was collected in Oceania.

Using country-level statistics, we were able to assess the extent to which the countries with data in CHILDES were a representative sample of countries in the world. Density plots are portrayed in Figure 3. The means for each of the variables differed for the countries in CHILDES versus overall in the world using unpaired samples t-tests without assuming equality of variance (Welch's t). Countries in CHILDES had a higher proportion of the population completing lower secondary school than the world wide sample (% compl. LSS, t(`r round(edt$parameter,2)`)=`r round(edt$statistic,2)`, p = `r round(edt$p.value,2)`); they were more urban (% urban, t(`r round(urbt$parameter,2)`)=`r round(urbt$statistic,2)`, p = `r round(urbt$p.value,2)`);  richer (log GDP per capita, t(`r round(gdpt$parameter,2)`)=`r round(gdpt$statistic,2)`, p = `r round(gdpt$p.value,2)`) and had lower fertility rates (log fertility, t(`r round(fertt$parameter,2)`)=`r round(fertt$statistic,2)`, p = `r round(fertt$p.value,2)`).

Education information was missing for more than half of the corpora (see Table 3); and `r sum(annotations$Education.STDZD=="diverse",na.rm=T)` were described as diverse, without clarifying the range of education covered. Of the remaining `r sum(!is.na(annotations$Education.min))` samples, `r sum(annotations$Education.min==1 & !is.na(annotations$Education.min))` had at least some parents with primary-level education;  `r sum(annotations$Education.min==2 & !is.na(annotations$Education.min))` had parents with secondary school education as the lower bound of the education range, and a further `r sum(annotations$Education.min==3 & !is.na(annotations$Education.min))` had some college as the lower bound. Thus, `r round(sum(annotations$Education.min>3 & !is.na(annotations$Education.min))/sum(!is.na(annotations$Education.min))*100)`% of the samples (N = `r sum(annotations$Education.min>3 & !is.na(annotations$Education.min))`) portrayed children whose parents had at least a graduate, if not a postgraduate, degree. Samples were not representative of the countries they were collected, since in those same countries the proportion of the population with tertiary education was only `r round(mean(annotations$College, na.rm=T))`%.



For socioeconomic status, there were `r sum(is.na(annotations$SES.STDZD))` missing values (`r round(sum(is.na(annotations$SES.STDZD))/length(annotations$SES.STDZD)*100)`%). Of the remaining `r sum(!is.na(annotations$SES.STDZD))` samples, `r sum(annotations$SES.STDZD==1 & !is.na(annotations$SES.STDZD))` were described as having low SES; `r sum(annotations$SES.STDZD=="1-2" & !is.na(annotations$SES.STDZD))` were described as spanning both lower and middle or higher SES; and `r sum(annotations$SES.STDZD==2 & !is.na(annotations$SES.STDZD))` were described as middle or higher SES exclusively. Given that most countries represented in CHILDES are in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, `r sum(annotations$oecd)` out of the `r dim(annotations)[1]` corpora), we can compare this proportion with the proportion of the population in these countries that are middle class. According to a 2016 report, “Almost two-thirds of people live in middle-income households in OECD countries”, for whom “household net income [is] between 0.75 and 2 times the median”. Thus, middle and higher class participants appear to be over-represented in CHILDES data, composing 81% of available data.

Information about parents’ profession or activity was also missing for the majority of the corpora (see Table 3). Professions were overall varied, but it should be noted that `r round(sum(annotations$is.academic=="yes" & !is.na(annotations$is.academic))/sum(!is.na(annotations$Parental.profession))*100)`% of the samples contained parents who were described as (Masters or PhD) students, professors, linguists, researchers, scientists, or academics. To give an idea of the extent to which this is not representative, consider the fact that in 2020, `r round((47000 +135000+20000000+3000000)/392000000*100)`% of the American population would be included in that list of professions. Similar data is hard to find for all countries represented in CHILDES, but we suspect that the proportion of scientists, professors, Masters and PhD students found in most other countries will be the same or lower.

<!-- in 2020, 47,000 people were scientists in the USA (including both in academia and the private sector), 135,000 were professors, 20 million were Masters students, and 3 million were PhD students. Given that the USA’s population is 392 million, -->


Only about a third of the samples had information about whether the community was rural or urban (see Table 3), and the remaining ones were very homogeneous. Setting aside  `r sum(is.na(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings))` missing values (`r round(sum(is.na(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings))/length(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings)*100)`%), and focusing on the remaining `r sum(!is.na(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings))` samples, `r sum(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings=="urban" & !is.na(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings))` were described as industrialized or urban, and an additional one as both rural and urban. Only `r sum(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings!="urban" & !is.na(annotations$Type.of.community.at.the.time.of.the.recordings))` samples were described as farming or rural. In these same countries, the proportion of the population residing in urban settings was `r round(mean(annotations$SP.URB.TOTL.ZS, na.rm=T))`%, suggesting that samples were not representative of their countries in terms of rural versus urban settings either.

We then turned to the additional factors, starting with how varied language backgrounds were. A total of 62 different languages or language combinations (for bilingual and multilingual children) were reportedly spoken in the corpora. The samples in which only one language was reported spoke `r mono_langs`, and the  samples in which multiple languages were reported spoke `r multi_langs`. 

About a third (`r round(sum(annotations$Bilingualism.Multilingualism.in.corpus=="yes" & !is.na(annotations$Bilingualism.Multilingualism.in.corpus)) /sum(!is.na(annotations$Bilingualism.Multilingualism.in.corpus))*100)`%) of the included corpora that had available data for this variable (N = `r sum(!is.na(annotations$Bilingualism.Multilingualism.in.corpus))`) were not monolingual. It is hard to find reliable estimates of the percentage of the population who are not monolingual in the world or in the countries represented in CHILDES, but for instance, in Europe in 2016, 65% of adults reported knowing multiple languages (Eurostat, 2022). According to such estimates, even if samples are linguistically diverse, it would appear that input data in CHILDES under-represents bilinguals and multilinguals.

<!-- https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Foreign_language_skills_statistics -->

As for family structure, `r  sum(annotations$Household.structure=="nuclear" & !is.na(annotations$Household.structure))` corpora (`r round(sum(annotations$Household.structure=="nuclear" & !is.na(annotations$Household.structure))/sum(!is.na(annotations$Household.structure))*100)`% of those that had data for this variable)  were based on nuclear families; in `r  sum(annotations$Household.structure=="extended" & !is.na(annotations$Household.structure))`  extended families were portrayed; and in `r  sum(annotations$Household.structure=="varied" & !is.na(annotations$Household.structure))` one sample the structure was varied. We do not know of a country-level index that would allow us to check whether CHILDES corpora are representative of their countries for this variable.



A majority of corpora in CHILDES include children who have siblings. In fact, only `r round(sum(annotations$Proportion.With.Siblings==0 & !is.na(annotations$Proportion.With.Siblings))/sum(!is.na(annotations$Proportion.With.Siblings))*100)`% of  samples  (among the `r sum(!is.na(annotations$Proportion.With.Siblings))` corpora having information on siblings) were constituted exclusively by children with no siblings, and the remaining had at least one sibling, with the overall average being `r round(mean(annotations$Average.number.of.siblings,na.rm=T),2)` siblings. Since `r round(sum(annotations$oecd)/length(annotations$oecd)*100)`% of countries in CHILDES are in the OECD, we draw a comparison point for such countries: `r round(mean(nkids$single,na.rm=T))`% of children had no siblings in OECD countries according to 2015 data. In this sense, children with multiple siblings appear to be over-represented in CHILDES.
